    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch
        tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna
        filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of
        small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere.
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
